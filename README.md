# Maintain Revision

![Main workflow](https://github.com/visiosto/maintain-revision/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg)

Maintain Revision is a GitHub Actions action for keeping the remote development version numbers of projects up to date. It creates the version for the current run of the project on GitHub Actions by reading the last development version number from S3 and uploads the new development version to the same S3 bucket.

## Usage

See [action.yml](https://github.com/visiosto/maintain-revision/blob/main/action.yml).
